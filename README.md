# Konttho

Konttho is a Bengali word for ‘Voice’. Through our project, we are trying to establish communication between specially abled people and normal people. A normal person is able to understand what the other person is trying to say using sign language which our machine learning model converts into simple text. Expressing your words without any barrier is what we are trying to achieve.

# Working:

We have created a user interactive website. The user can login to the website and follow the instructions as stated there. Clicking on the start button will start the application. After that they just need to show the signs and the app takes it down from here. It translates and communicates what the user tries to convey. Users can also download their conversation after finishing their work.
